## Reactive Spring

Using Angular for front end framework and Spring Boot + MongoDB for back end, the project is a 1-page web app allowing user to 
view rooms models in a hotel and reserve the room. The front end sends HTTP requests to the backend to populate the 
database with reservation records.

****
To run
- run the ReactiveSpringApplication or use the Gradle tasks to start up the back end code
- start up the front end by `ng serve` or locate `package.json` for more options
